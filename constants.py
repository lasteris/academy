Since you joined {1.name}, you need to know how we attack raids.

We __**coordinate**__ our attacks. (**always read raid-plan**, we can add instructions before each raid)

1. When a **raid captain** says to prepare for a boss
    - Captain Cold (CC)
    - Gorilla Grodd (GG)
    - Scarecrow (HSC)
    - Doctor Fate (DF)
    - Brainiac (Brainy or Brnc)
You are supposed to make your teams and say "ready" when done.
2. The captain will ask for "ready check" or "final call", everyone will respond with "ready" to show they are attentive and not away from the game.
3. Finally, the captain will say "Go", then you can attack the boss.

Next, we conduct either one day or two day raids. (check the raid plan)

One day raid means we finish the entire raid in 3 pips, so we must plan our teams wisely for maximum damage wherever needed,
Two day raid means we finish the raid in 6 pips, over 2 days."""
